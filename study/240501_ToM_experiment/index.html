        <h2 id="모델-평가-reproducibility">모델 평가 Reproducibility</h2>

<p>일단 데이터를 믿기 어렵다. 생성하는 방식 및 평가하는 방식에 따라서 결과값이 계속 달라지게 된다. 데이터에 문제가 있었다. 특정 레이블 (B) 값이 정답으로 사용되었는데, LLM이 단순히 B값을 예측하게 되는 경우 정답율이 100% 가까이 나왔다. 이를 개선하기 위해서 레이블을 섞었고, 정확도는 떨어지게 되었다. 데이터에 대해서 모델의 결과를 평가하는 경우 입력과 출력이 공정하게 형성되었는지 파악하는 것이 중요하다.</p>

<p>입출력 값이 편향적으로 생성되는 경우, 예측 결과를 신빙할 수 없다. 예를 들어서, 90:10으로 데이터의 분포가 이루어지는 경우, 90으로 찍어서 정확도 90%가 나오는지, 아니면 balance를 비슷하게 유지한 상태에서 90%가 나오는지 알기 어렵다. 따라서 모델의 정확도를 측정하기 위해서 정답은 될 수 있는한 찍기 어렵게 만들어야 한다. 그러나 QA 형태로 closed answer를 하는 경우 제대로 된 예측이 어렵다. 이를 해결하기 위해서 ToMChallenge 논문<d-cite key="ma2023tomchallenges"></d-cite>에서도 autograder라는 방식으로 도입했다. 이 방식은 GPT4를 사용하기에 실요성이 낮지만, ToM을 평가하기 위해서 필요한 방법인 것 같다. ToM은 일반적으로 인간의 높은 인지 수준을 요구한다. 따라서 레이블을 사람이 직관적으로 한 눈에 예측하기 어렵다.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Code for ToM : <a href="https://github.com/fxnnxc/llm/tree/v24.04.29_ToM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">github</a>
</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2 id="믿을만한-tom-결과">믿을만한 ToM 결과</h2>

<p>일반 적어도 모델이 어느 부분에 있어서 어느정도 ToM을 보여야 한다. 
그런데 context도 길고 모델이 제대로 이해하고 대답하는지 잘 모르겠다.</p>

<p>일단 기대한대로 reality에 대한 예측은 높게 나와야 한다. 
나머지 부분에 대해서는 second-order mind로 갈수록 예측 정확도가 떨어져야 한다. 
실험 결과는 예상한대로 나왔다.</p>

<p>한 가지 방법은 정답에 대해서 다양한 형태로 예측을 하여 gold answers 를 생성하고 가장 높은 정확도를 사용하는 것이다.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>예시: A,B 모두 타월이 바구니에 있는 것을 확인하였고, B가 없을 때 A는 타월을 쓰레기통에 넣었다.</p>
  </li>
  <li>1stA: A는 현재 타월이 어디 있다고 생각하는가? (쓰레기통)</li>
  <li>1stB: B는 현재 타월이 어디 있다고 생각하는가? (바구니)</li>
  <li>2ndA: A가 생각하는 B의 타월 추정 위치는? (바구니)</li>
  <li>2ndB: B가 생각하는 A의 타월 추정 위치는? (바구니)</li>
</ul>

<br></p>

<p>Reality와 First A에 대해서는 정확도가 상대적으로 높은 것을 볼 수 있다. 반대로 1stB와 2nd에 대해서는 정확도가 대단히 낮다.</p>

<blockquote>
사실 이 부분을 제대로 측정하기 위해서는 정답의 반대 레이블에 대한 믿음이 높은지 확인해야 한다. 해당 점수에서는 틀린 것에 대해서 hallucination을 포함하고 있기 때문이다. 
즉, 0% 정확도가 나오는 부분이 ToM을 실패해서 나온 것인지 모델의 예측이 포맷이 안 맞아서 그런 것인지 확인해야 한다.
